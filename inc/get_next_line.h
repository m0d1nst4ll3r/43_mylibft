/*	Program structure and steps:
 *
 * 	The program uses two chained lists. One to handle multiple fds (one
 * 	 node per fd), another to handle buffer reading (each buffer has its
 * 	 own node).
 *
 *	1. List to hold memory for each fd
 *		- fd		which fd the node is using
 *		- buf		its memorized buffers
 *					these buffers are their own list (see below)
 *	2. List for buffer management
 *		- buf		the buffer sent to read
 *		- len		len returned by read
 *		- index		last pos in the buffer (for multi-newline buffers)
 *
 *	Steps:
 *
 *	1. Fetch fd's node if any, or create it
 *	2. Check buffer if any (leftover from last call)
 *		- We are checking for end condition (newline, or EOF)
 *		- EOF condition is recognized by len (read return) being less
 *		   than BUFFER_SIZE (meaning read was not full)
 *	3. Start reading in a loop, checking buffer every time
 *		- Every new read goes into its own node in the chained list
 *	4. Once end buffer is found, write the line and return
 *		- Line is written by parsing buffer list
 *		- After each buffer node is copied, it is freed
 *		- If last node is not copied completely, its index is updated
 *		   and it's placed at the start of the list for the next call
 *
 *	In case of read or malloc error, free buffer list and fd's node.
 *	After having read a file completely, free fd's node.
 *
 *	Note:
 *
 *	In this implementation, memory is not optimized for remainders
 *	 from full or partial reads.
 *
 *	  E.g, for BUFFER_SIZE of 1024:
 *
 *		- For a full read where a newline is found at index 999, there
 *		   only remain 24 bytes, but we are holding 1024 bytes in memory.
 *
 *		- For a partial read of 11 where a newline is found at index 9,
 *		   we are holding 1024 bytes for 1 remaining byte.
 *
 *	This amount of memory will be held until the next call for each
 *	 open fd. The higher BUFFER_SIZE is, the more wasted memory.
 *	Therefore, it is highly encouraged to either keep BUFFER_SIZE
 *	 reasonable or to make sure you are reading files completely.
